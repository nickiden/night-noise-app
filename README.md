this is a noise app to help people sleep




Main Page

The main page after the application starts up has a simple scroll up/down, left/right navigation system. The user can check categories and sounds all on the first screen. This is done by using navigation views and generating lists. This is convent for future updating and adding new categories.

Sound Card

The sound card page is a simple photo, description, and start button. The user can easily play sounds and stop sounds all with a single push. The images and sounds are all referenced with .json file. This makes updating easy to manage, a simple view is made and populated based on the .json reference.

About Page

This view is made with SwiftUI forms. Adding links for the YouTube channel, text, and buttons is easy.
